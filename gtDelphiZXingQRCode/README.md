gtDelphiZXingQRCode
=================

### Threaded version of DelphiZXingQRCode ###

* The FMX version works *

* Worked over 10 hours straight to get this threaded version of DelphiZXingQRCode working with all the bug fixes, updates, and errors reported on the original DelphiZXingQRCode page. *

I'll upload a full sample application later, for now I'll just upload a sample.pas.

gtDelphiZXingQRCode uses the code from DelphiZXingQRCode and combines all the pull requests for errors and bug fixes.  gtDelphiZXingQRCode also uses code from the JSiQRCodeGenerator fork for the VCL / FMX non-visual components.  JSiQRCodeGenerator did not have any updates and seemed to only convert the original to components.

# Getting Started #

A sample .pas is provided in the TestApp folder to demonstrate how to use gtDelphiZXingQRCode. 
Simply add or correct the FMX.DelphiZXIngQRCode.pas & gtQRCodeGenFMX.pas paths to the SampleFMX Delphi project and compile.

I'll update this later when I have a better sample project.
