# gtDelphi

  gtDelphiCSV is a component is meant to break down CSV files
  by reading each line of the csv file.  You can change the CSV file contents
  line by line if the isModified is set to true via the OnProcess procedure.

  Roadmap:
  - Create package files for redistribute for others to use in all delphi platforms
  - Create a demo application with source code
  - Add Multi-Threading ability cross platform
  - OnProgress add PrecentageDone : byte 0 - 100 %
  - Add more ways to process files
